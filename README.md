# ZK-StriderWars-AI
A repository of circuitAI configs for use with ZK-StriderWars-V1 MOD within Zero-K (FREE Real Time Strategy Game).

These AIs will mass produce Striders! Currently just one AI developed.

It's easy to add any AI to Zero-K.

The instuctions below are from Shaman's (awesome) Zero-K Future Wars MOD. These Instuctions work for any AI install.

Usage:

To use these AIs:

1.) Open steam, right click zero-k in your library and press properties. Click on Installed Files. Click "Browse". Go to AI then Skirmish. If you're not on steam, go to your Zero-K install's location then go to AI then Skirmish. (EG: Zero-K/AI/Skirmish)

2.) Download AI and drop the folder (SW-Striders-V1) into your zero-K AI/Skirmish folder. like (Zero-K/AI/Skirmish/SW-Striders-V1) which would then be like (Zero-K/AI/Skirmish/SW-Striders-V1/stable/...)

3.) In your Zero-K install directory, create a new file named "devmode" as a text file (either by creating a file called "devmode.txt" or creating a new text file and naming it "devmode")

4.) Close Zero-K, if it's already open.

5.) (Re)launch Zero-K and in the lobby, go to Settings. If you sucessfully enabled devmode in step 3, you should see a new Developer tab appear. Under this tab, there is a setting called "Simple AI List", disable this and you should now see a larger list of AIs with the new AI selectable. Note: you may want to use simple AI list when not using custom AIs as running the wrong circuit AI version may crash your game.

If you have performed the above steps correctly, you should see the new AIs. To uninstall or revert to normal AI list, just check the Simple AI list setting again.
